# Gradient routing
A companion repository for [Gradient Routing: Masking Gradients to Localize Computation in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04332).


## Repo structure
* `factored_representations` is for shared functionality, although in practice, code for different subprojects is mostly siloed
    * `masklib.py` and `model_expansion.py` implement Expand, Route, Ablate for any [TransformerLens](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/) model.
    * Has some tests
* `projects` contains the code to reproduce the results in the paper
    * `minigrid` - localizing behavioral tendencies in a gridworld reinforcement learning agent
    * `mnist` - splitting representations of an MNIST autoencoder
    * `nanoGPT-factrep` - training a model with a steering scalar, and unlearning virology
    * `tinystories` - unlearning a subset of [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)
* `shared_configs` is for commonly-used configurations, e.g. model definitions, standard training config options

## To use

1. Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/)
2. Install the PDM project (ie. install the dependencies)
    ```bash
    pdm install
    ```
3. Install the recommended VSCode extensions
4. Install the pre-commit git hooks
    ```bash
    pdm run pre-commit install
    ```

You can then run Python scripts with `pdm run python <script.py>` or by activating the
virtual environment specified by `pdm info`. Eg:
```bash
source /pdm-venvs/factored-representations-Dp430888-3.12/bin/activate
```

`.vscode/settings.json` is configured to automatically format and lint the code with
[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (using the extension) on save.

## Tests

Run the tests with:
```bash
pdm run pytest
```

# MNIST representation splitting

This directory covers all MNIST representation splitting results. All the good stuff is in `representation_splitting.py`, particularly in the `SplitAutoencoder` class and `calculate_split_losses()` function. There is a bit of boilerplate here to enable easy configuration.

The ablation results in the appendix of the paper were generated by `runs_for_paper_main.py` and tabulated in `analyze_runs_for_paper_main.py`.

# Tinystories unlearning

This directory covers all Tinystories unlearning results. The main experiment logic (model pretraining) is in `tinystories_era.py`. This is called into by `bulk_runs_for_paper.py` and `bulk_runs_partial_oversight.py`, which configure and orchestrate the runs to get the results in the paper (in addition to `rmu.py`, run separately). High-level configurations shared across all runs are specified in `shared_settings.py`. Any script starting with `analyze_*` reads in a CSV generated by another script and produces tables/figures based on it. Any script starting with `explore_*` is for exploratory data analysis and should have no dependencies.
